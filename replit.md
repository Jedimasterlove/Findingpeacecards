## Overview

Finding Peace is a web-based relationship building platform that provides structured guidance through interactive card decks. The application serves educational content focused on emotional intelligence, communication skills, and relationship foundations through an elegant, responsive interface.

All 34 conversation cards across 6 therapeutic decks are accessible with enhanced content organization. Admin interface available for manual content editing.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom peace-themed color palette
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite middleware integration

### Mobile-First Design
The application is designed as a mobile-first progressive web app with:
- Maximum width constraints (max-w-md) for phone-like experience
- Touch-friendly navigation with bottom navigation bar
- Card-based UI patterns optimized for small screens
- Shadow effects and rounded corners for app-like feel

## Key Components

### Database Schema
**Card Decks Table**: Stores deck metadata including title, description, color themes, and ordering
**Cards Table**: Contains individual card content with categories, previews, and deck associations
**Users Table**: Basic user management with username/password authentication (not currently implemented in UI)

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/decks` - Retrieve all available card decks
- `GET /api/decks/:key` - Get specific deck by key
- `GET /api/decks/:key/cards` - Get all cards for a specific deck
- `GET /api/cards/:id` - Get individual card details

### Storage Layer
Implements an interface-based storage pattern with in-memory implementation for development. The system includes:
- User management capabilities
- Card deck CRUD operations
- Card content management
- Pre-populated content for Foundation, Listening, and other relationship topics

### UI Components
- **Header Component**: Branded header with navigation and deck-specific styling
- **Bottom Navigation**: Fixed bottom navigation with Home, Search, Saved, Profile tabs
- **Card Deck Grid**: Responsive grid layout for deck browsing
- **Card Display**: Full-screen card reader with navigation between cards

## Data Flow

1. **Application Bootstrap**: React app initializes with TanStack Query client
2. **Route Handling**: Wouter manages navigation between dashboard, deck view, and card view
3. **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query handles API calls with caching and error handling
4. **State Management**: Server state cached by TanStack Query, UI state managed locally
5. **Content Rendering**: Cards display rich content with navigation controls
